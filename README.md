# Trainingsplan ICS Generator

## Overview

This application reads an Excel file containing a training plan and generates an ICS file that can be imported into a calendar application. The ICS file includes events for each training session with the specified date, title, and description.

## How It Works

1. **Reading the Excel File**: The application uses the `xlsx` library to read the Excel file located in the `assets` folder.
2. **Parsing the Data**: The data from the Excel file is parsed to extract the dates, titles, and descriptions of the training sessions.
3. **Generating ICS File**: The `ics` library is used to create an ICS file with events for each training session.
4. **Serving the ICS File**: The application uses `express` to create a server that provides an endpoint to download the generated ICS file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trainingsplan.git

```

2. Install the dependencies

3. Place your Excel file (`trainingsplan_test.xlsx`) in the assets folder.
4. Start the server

5. Open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/api/generate-ics`. The ICS file will be downloaded automatically.
